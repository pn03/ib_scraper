You have to accommodate the horses into the stables in such a way that the following <strong>conditions are satisfied:</strong></p><blockquote>  <ul>    <li>You fill the horses into the stables preserving the relative order of horses. For instance, you cannot put horse 1 into stable 2 and horse 2 into stable 1. You have to preserve the ordering of the horses.</li>    <li>No stable should be empty and no horse should be left unaccommodated.</li>    <li>Take the product (<code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">number of white horses * number of black horses</code>) for each stable and take the sum of all these products. This value should be the minimum among all possible accommodation arrangements</li>  </ul></blockquote><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Input: {WWWB} , K = 2Output: 0Explanation:We have 3 choices {W, WWB}, {WW, WB}, {WWW, B}for first choice we will get 1*0 + 2*1 = 2.for second choice we will get 2*0 + 1*1 = 1.for third choice we will get 3*0 + 0*1 = 0.Of the 3 choices, the third choice is the best option. </code></pre></div><p><strong>If a solution is not possible, then return -1</strong></p>                          <blockquote style=\"position:relative;\">                              <span style=\"font-weight: normal;margin: 12px;\">                                  <b>NOTE: </b>You only need to implement the given function.
