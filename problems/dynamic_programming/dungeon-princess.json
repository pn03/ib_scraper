The dungeon consists of <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">M x N</code> rooms laid out in a 2D grid.

If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.</p><br><br><p>Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (0&#x2019;s) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight&#x2019;s health (positive integers).</p><br><br><p>In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.</p><br><br><p><strong>Write a function to determine the knight&#x2019;s minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.</strong></p><br><br><p>For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path</p><br><br><p><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">RIGHT-&gt; RIGHT -&gt; DOWN -&gt; DOWN</code>.</p><br><br><p><img src=\"dynamic_programming_assets/Q_dungeon_princess_1.png\" alt=\"Dungeon Princess: Example 1\"></p><br><br><p><br><br><br><strong>Input arguments to function:</strong><br><br>Your function will get  an M*N matrix (2-D array) as input which represents the 2D grid as described in the question.
