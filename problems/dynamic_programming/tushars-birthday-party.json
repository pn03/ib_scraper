A friend is satisfied if the sum of the filling capacity of dishes he ate is equal to his capacity. Find the minimum cost such that all of Tushar&#x2019;s friends are satisfied (reached their eating capacity).</p><br><br><p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p><br><ol><br>  <li>Each dish is supposed to be eaten by only one person.
