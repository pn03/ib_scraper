Now your tank has 1 unit of gas. But you need B[0] = 2 gas to travel to station 1.         If you start from index 1, you can fill in A[1] = 2 amount of gas. Now your tank has 2 units of gas. You need B[1] = 1 gas to get to station 0. So, you travel to station 0 and still have 1 unit of gas left over. You fill in A[0] = 1 unit of additional gas, making your current gas = 2. It costs you B[0] = 2 to get to station 1, which you do and complete the circuit. </code></pre></div>                          <blockquote style=\"position:relative;\">                              <span style=\"font-weight: normal;margin: 12px;\">                                  <b>NOTE: </b>You only need to implement the given function.
